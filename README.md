# Website Performance Analysis

This project explores and analyzes website traffic and user engagement data using Python.  
It demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow from cleaning to visualization.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Renaming columns, handling missing values, and preparing raw CSV data for analysis using **pandas**.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and trends in website sessions, user engagement, and event metrics.  
- **Data Visualization**: Creating clear, insightful charts and heatmaps with **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to illustrate key performance indicators.  
- **Analytical Thinking**: Interpreting user behavior metrics such as engagement rate and events per session to draw actionable insights.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: Loaded website performance data and reformatted headers for readability.  
2. **Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Converted date-time columns, ensured correct data types, and handled missing or inconsistent values.  
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Investigated trends in sessions, users, and engagement over time.  
4. **Visualization**: Produced bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to highlight traffic patterns and engagement metrics.  
5. **Insights**: Derived conclusions on user activity and potential areas for website performance optimization.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- pandas, numpy
